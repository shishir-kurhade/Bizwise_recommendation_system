# Bizwise_recommendation_system
Summary
Bizwise is a business recommendation system used to generate insights from the Yelp
Dataset. The system attempts to answer basic questions that need contemplation before
starting a business with regard to location,competitors and their performance, unique
selling points, peak business hours, and most importantly customer reviews about competitors.
These factors help a businessman make better decisions before investing his
capital and earn good profit. Jim Collins once said very eloquently, “You are the bus driver.
The bus, your company is at a standstill and it’s on you to get it going. You have to make
the decision where you are going, how you are going to get there and who all are going
with you.” Our data visualization and modeling answers some of these questions and
gives business recommendations.
